My name is Ben Dobson and I offer personal fitness training, both for individuals and groups. Are you looking for someone who can take your fitness to the next level? Then look no further. I have 10+ years of experience working with people from different fitness backgrounds and everyone has benefitted from my training. Let's workout!

Need to run a marathon soon? Looking to beat the world record in deadlifting? Well, Ben Dobson to the rescue (I can't guarantee you will beat the world record though...). All my clients get a personal training program and I am available 24/7 for your fitness needs. I am also a diet expert so I can also set up a diet plan if necessary.

More and more people are seeing the benefits of being fit. Not just for a few months, but fit for life. Become happier, healthier, fitter and stronger with my fitness program. I am looking forward to meeting you!
